# Triangulating Arbitrary Polygons

By combining the algorithm for [splitting polygons to monotone pieces]
(monotone-pieces.html) with an algorithm for [triangulating monotone polygons]
(monotone-triangulation.html), we can triangulate arbitrary polygons.

The following image shows a triangulated polygon. The monotone pieces
are shown in different colors and each of these pieces is triangulated
independently.
